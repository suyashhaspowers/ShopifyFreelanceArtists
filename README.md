# ShopifyFreelanceArtists (Incl. Image Repository)
MERN-based web application that allows Shopify merchants to find and hire Freelance Artists to help them take pictures of their products, design their websites, build professional graphics etc. This service will allow freelance artists to sign up, describe their work, state their price, and provide an image repository of their work for potential shopify merchants. This tool can be used with other Shopify services that helps businesses streamline creating an online presence for themselves. 

Created as a part of Shopify's Backend Developer Internship Application. The portfolio section which allows Freelancers to upload images of their work acts as an image repository.
